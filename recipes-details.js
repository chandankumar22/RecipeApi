Robed men sell ornate carpets and a camel nibbles affectionately at your ear.  OK, we’re pretty sure Paul McKenna’s job is safe for now, but get cooking this recipe and take dinnertime on a magic carpet ride to Casablanca! Our tip for this recipe is to take your meat out of the fridge at least 30 minutes before dinner which will allow you to cook it more evenly.",

For our intern Simon, it was this lip-smackingly awesome Sea Bream. Taking the warm crunchiness of potatoes against the fresh southern asian flavours of fish with coriander, ginger and lime, it’s the perfect dish for transporting your tastebuds. Don’t let the smell of the fish sauce throw you - add it gradually to your sauce for a really authentic asian spin!",
